 NAME
     {host} - no bullshit command line pastebin

 SYNOPSIS
     # View helptext
     curl {host} -L

     # Upload file
     curl {host} -LT <file path>

     # Upload command output
     <command> | curl {host} -LT -

 DESCRIPTION
     A simple, no bullshit, tamper-proof command line pastebin.

     Pastes are created using HTTP PUT requests, which returns a
     determanistic paste URL. Filenames are ignored in the URL
     and can be modified or removed entirely.

     Paste downloads can be verified by doing the following:
         1) Get the checksum from the HTTP header `x-content-hash`

         2) Verify the checksum by re-encoding with base58 and
            ensuring it matches the slice in the paste URL

         3) Verify the recieved content by hashing with blake3 and
            comparing against the checksum.

     Pastes are always deleted from storage after some time. Once
     deleted, the content will remain available in regions that have
     it cached still. However, content can always be re-uploaded to
     the same paste URL.

 NOTES
     * Maximum file size    :   {max_size}
     * Storage TTL          :   {kv_ttl}
     * Regional cache TTL   :   {cache_ttl}
     * All time uploads     :   {upload_counter}

 EXAMPLES
     $ echo 'testing' | curl {host} -LT -
       https://{host}/deadbeef

     $ curl https://{host}/deadbeef
       testing
