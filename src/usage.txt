 NAME
     {host} - no bullshit command line pastebin

 SYNOPSIS
     * View helptext  :  curl {host} -L
     * Upload file    :  curl {host} -LT <file path>
     * Upload stdin   :  <command> | curl {host} -LT -

 DESCRIPTION
     A simple, no bullshit, tamper-proof command line pastebin.

     Pastes are created using HTTP PUT requests, which returns a URL
     based on the hash of the content. Filenames are ignored and can
     be added, modified, or removed entirely.

     Upload URLs and downloaded content can be optionally verified
     by hashing the content with blake3 and encoding the raw hash
     with base58. If the id in the URL does not match, the server
     response is invalid and the service has been tampered with.

     Pastes are always deleted from storage after some time. Once
     deleted, the content will remain available in regions that have
     it cached still. However, content can always be re-uploaded to
     the same paste URL.

 NOTES
     * Maximum file size   :  {max_size}
     * Storage TTL         :  {kv_ttl}
     * Regional cache TTL  :  {cache_ttl}
     * All time uploads    :  {upload_counter}

 EXAMPLES
     * Upload from stdin:
         $ echo 'testing' | curl {host} -LT -
           https://{host}/Ag1BhjbD
         $ curl https://{host}/Ag1BhjbD
           testing

     * Verified upload (using b3sum + bs58-cli):
         $ echo 'testing' > file
         $ b3sum file --raw | bs58
           Ag1BhjbDQMUjq2rEQVgTNMPFEm8gTUmaJTRw4LUx1u78
         $ curl {host} -LT file
           https://{host}/Ag1BhjbD

     * Verified download (using b3sum + bs58-cli):
         $ curl https://{host}/Ag1BhjbD | tee file | b3sum --raw | bs58
           Ag1BhjbDQMUjq2rEQVgTNMPFEm8gTUmaJTRw4LUx1u78
         $ cat ./file
           testing

     * Simple password encryption (using gpg):
         $ echo 'testing' | gpg -o- -c | curl {host} -LT -
           https://{host}/exmpLhsh
         $ curl https://{host}/exmpLhsh | gpg -d
           gpg: AES256.CFB encrypted data
           gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
           testing

     * Sending and applying a git patch:
         $ git diff | curl {host} -LT -
           https://{host}/deadbeef
         $ git apply <(curl https://{host}/deadbeef)
